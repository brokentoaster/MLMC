The MLMC is a smart daisy chain-able LED matrix module. I call it smart because a display of these can be extended without changing either the firmware on the module controller or the firmware on the display controller. Each individual module will take care of refreshing its display. When new data is sent old data is passed along the chain to the next module. This makes building an arbitrary length scrolling display very simple to implement.

The LED matrix is on a separate PCB so it is simple to adapt to other LED matrices without chaining the controller PCB/firmware. This means that if you were producing a number of different sized displays you could use the same controller PCB. For example for one made from a 16 by 16 LED matrices or a large one made from custom PCBs using 16 by 16 individual 10mm LEDs.
